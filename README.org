#+TITLE: Hiisi - Process & Port Manager
#+AUTHOR: Lukáš Hozda
#+DATE: 2024

* About
Hiisi (named after forest spirits) is a daemon-based process and port management
system designed specifically for the velho server and its trusted users. It allows
unprivileged users to:
- Run background processes persistently
- Manage their own services
- Allocate and manage ports
- Monitor their processes

** Design Philosophy
- Trust-based port allocation (no real security!)
- Simple Unix socket communication
- User isolation (processes run as requesting user)
- Clear process ownership and management

Note: This is not a security-focused tool. It assumes users are trusted and
won't attempt to abuse the system. Perfect for small, trusted communities :-)

* Architecture
** Components
- =hiidet= :: The daemon (runs as root)
- =hiisi= :: User CLI tool
- =hiisi-common= :: Shared protocol definitions

** Communication
- Unix socket at =/run/hiisi/hiisi.sock=
- JSON-based protocol with length-prefixed frames
- Async I/O using tokio

** Process Management
- Each process has unique ID
- Stdout/stderr captured to =/home/user/.logs/=
- Optional auto-restart capability
- Graceful shutdown (SIGINT → SIGTERM → SIGKILL)

** Port Management
- Range: 1024-65535
- Persistent allocations via RON file
- Trust-based (no technical restrictions)

* Usage
** Running Processes
#+begin_example
# Start process (current env and cwd preserved)
hiisi run ./my_server --port 8080

# Start with auto-restart
hiisi run --restart ./my_server --port 8080

# List running processes
hiisi status

# View process logs
hiisi logs <id>

# Stop process
hiisi stop <id>
#+end_example

** Managing Ports
#+begin_example
# Allocate random port
hiisi port allocate

# Allocate specific port
hiisi port allocate 8080

# List allocated ports
hiisi port lookup

# List ports for specific user
hiisi port lookup username

# Free port
hiisi port free 8080
#+end_example

* Installation
** Requirements
- Rust toolchain
- Linux system
- Root access (for daemon)

** Building
#+begin_example
cargo build --release
#+end_example

** Installation
#+begin_example
# Install binaries
install -m755 target/release/hiidet /usr/sbin/
install -m755 target/release/hiisi /usr/bin/

# Create required directories
mkdir -p /run/hiisi
mkdir -p /etc/hiisi
#+end_example

* TODO [0/2]
- [ ] Export monitoring metrics via HTTP endpoint
 - System-wide metrics
 - Per-user metrics
 - Process-specific metrics
- [ ] Implement port usage detection
 - Regular checks if allocated ports are being used
 - Garbage collection of unused port allocations
